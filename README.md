## BomberMan Rapid prototype for 2-Local Players, in Unreal Engine within in 15 hours

> Engine version 4.18.2 (4.19 is out, but I will differ the update after this)

 This is going to be a quick 15 hour hacky prototype implementation in UE 4.18.2. I will be doing this is 1-2 sessions. This is supposed to be implemented with a mix of C++ and Blue-print scripting. But I am not yet certain on which parts to seperate out that way, as there  may not be need for a Centrailzed 'Game Manage' or Game-mode for the simple gameplay.  I prefer to implement this in Entity-Component system, and not much of Parent, Child classes as the logic is quite simple.  I personally, prefer to *Write Code* than connect nodes and graphs, as most programmers do.  
 
My goal here is to get a Polished feel to the game rather than a Programmersque Box-Sphere-Plane POC (Besides, I'm reluctant to install Windows 8 SDK, Unreal VS Extension, etc on my overloaded Laptop). Pure blue-print approach will probably save time,in the 15 hours, I rather use to make it polished, create sounds and P-FX instead

>2:04 am (Almost 6 hours into the project).  I am not happy with the progress.

## Session 2
Could not get Visual studio 2015 to work with my recent update to UE 4.18.2. Need VS2017 for it. The 128GB SSD on my laptop is a pain (Always on 10GB free space borderline). Gotta remove vs2015 to make space (D: for VS not a good idea).

Created a Project section with simple kanban board(Github only keeps getting better)
Current task https://github.com/Skeletalmesh/UEBomberMan/projects/1#card-7172737  
Taaking a couple of hours - break 

Overall, I am running out of the 15 hours.
